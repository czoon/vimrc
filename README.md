# vimrc
My personal, self-installing vimrc file.

This file allows to quickly set up Vim (or NeoVim), only requiring you to manually clone it and follow the configuration process. 

Once installed, your setup will include...

 - Vundle, with plugins such as...
 	- vim-startify.
 	- vim-airline.
 	- vim-airline-themes.
 - Another changes.

### How to install

**If you are a Vim user**, put the file inside ***~/.vim/*** in your personal folder.

**If you are a NeoVim user**, put the file inside ***.config/nvim/init.vim*** in your personal folder in Linux or, if you are a Windows user, inside ***C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\nvim***.

Run the following command if Vim is already open,

```bash
:source %
```
or restart it again. You will be prompted with a dialog. Follow the instructions to complete the configuration process.
