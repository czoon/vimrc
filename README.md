# vimrc
My personal vimrc file, used as a mere personal backup. 

The main idea is to turn this file into a self installation configuration script, which gets everything ready to work from scratch. 

### How to install

**If you are a Vim user**, put the file inside ***~/.vim/*** in your personal folder.

**If you are a NeoVim user**, put the file inside ***.config/nvim/init.vim*** in your personal folder in Linux or, if you are a Windows user, inside ***C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\nvim***.

Run the following command if Vim is already open,

```bash
:source %
```
or restart it again. You will be prompted with a dialog. Follow the instructions to complete the configuration process.
