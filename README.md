# vimrc
My personal vimrc file, used as a mere backup.

### How can I install it?

Just place the file inside ***~/.vim/*** in your personal folder, and then run the following commands in Vim:

```bash
:source %

:PluginInstall
```

Wait until all the plugins are installed and reboot Vim, or use the following command in Vim:

```bash
:so $MYVIMRC
```
