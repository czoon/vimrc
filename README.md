# vimrc
My personal vimrc file, used as a mere backup.

### Can I clone this repository?

Sure! Even if I don't know why would you want to...

### How can I install it?

Just place the file inside ***~/.vim/*** in your personal folder, and then run the following commands in Vim:

```bash
:source %

:PluginInstall
```

Wait until all the plugins are installed and reboot Vim. Everything should be working! :)
